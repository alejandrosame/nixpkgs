The NixOS release team is happy to announce a new version of NixOS. The release is called NixOS 23.11 ("Tapir").

NixOS is a Linux distribution, whose set of packages can also be used on other Linux systems and macOS.

Support is planned until the end of June 2024, handing over to NixOS 24.05.

To upgrade to the latest release, follow the upgrade chapter and check the [Breaking Changes](#sec-release-23.11-nixos-breaking-changes)

The team is excited about the many software updates and improvements in this release. Just to name a few, do check the updates
for `GNOME` packages, `systemd`, `glibc`, the `ROCM` package set, and `hostapd` (which brings support for WiFi6 (IEEE 802.11ax) and WPA3-SAE-PK).

Make sure to also check the many updates in the [Nixpkgs library](#sec-release-23.11-nixpkgs-lib) when developing your own packages.
