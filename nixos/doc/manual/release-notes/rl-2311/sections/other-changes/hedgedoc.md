- `services.hedgedoc` has been heavily refactored, reducing the amount of declared options in the module. Most of the options should still work without any changes. Some options have been deprecated, as they no longer have any effect. See [#244941](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/244941) for more details.
