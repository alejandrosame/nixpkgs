- `services.hedgedoc` has been heavily refactored, reducing the amount of
  declared options in the module. Most of the options should still work without
  any changes to the configuration. Some options have been deprecated, as they
  no longer have any effect. Refer to [PR
  #244941](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/244941) for more details.
