- The option `services.plausible.releaseCookiePath` has been removed: Plausible does not use any distributed Erlang features, and does not plan to (see [discussion](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/130297#issuecomment-1805851333)), so NixOS now disables them, and the Erlang cookie becomes unnecessary. You may delete the file that `releaseCookiePath` was set to.
