- The `junicode` font package has been updated to [major version 2](https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/releases/tag/v2.001), which is now a font family. In particular, plain `Junicode.ttf` no longer exists. In addition, TrueType font files are now placed in `font/truetype` instead of `font/junicode-ttf`; this change does not affect use via `fonts.packages` NixOS option.
