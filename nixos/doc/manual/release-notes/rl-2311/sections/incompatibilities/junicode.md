- The `junicode` font package has been updated to [major
  v2](https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/releases/tag/v2.001), which is
  a font family now. In particular, plain `Junicode.ttf` no longer exists. In
  addition, TrueType font files are now placed in `font/truetype` instead of
  `font/junicode-ttf`; this change does not affect use via `fonts.packages`
  option.
