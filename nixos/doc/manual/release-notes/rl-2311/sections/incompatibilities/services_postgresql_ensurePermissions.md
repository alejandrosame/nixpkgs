- `services.postgresql.ensurePermissions` has been deprecated in favor of `services.postgresql.ensureUsers.*.ensureDBOwnership` which simplifies the setup of database owned by a certain system user
  in local database contexts (which make use of peer authentication via UNIX sockets), migration guidelines were provided in the NixOS manual, please refer to them if you are affected by a PostgreSQL 15 changing the way `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES` is working. `services.postgresql.ensurePermissions` will be removed in 24.05. All NixOS modules were migrated using one of the strategy, e.g. `ensureDBOwnership` or `postStart`. More about this situation can be learnt in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/266270.
