- `trilium-desktop` and `trilium-server` have been updated to
  [v0.61](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.61.12). For existing
  installations, upgrading to this version is supported only after running
  v0.60.x at least once. If you are still on an older version, make sure to
  update to v0.60 (available in NixOS 23.05) first and only then to v0.61
  (available in NixOS 23.11).
