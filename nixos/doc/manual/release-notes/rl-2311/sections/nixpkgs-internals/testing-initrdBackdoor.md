- There is a new NixOS option when writing NixOS tests `testing.initrdBackdoor`, that enables `backdoor.service` in initrd. Requires `boot.initrd.systemd.enable` to be enabled. Boot will pause in stage 1 at `initrd.target`, and will listen for commands from the `Machine` python interface, just like stage 2 normally does. This enables commands to be sent to test and debug stage 1. Use `machine.switch_root()` to leave stage 1 and proceed to stage 2.
